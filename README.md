# taps

taps is a simple game made with Angular (12) and Ionic (5).

Goals of this projects:
- getting better with Angular
- building something with the Canvas API
- using Ionic to create web & hybrid mobile apps (game).
- writting a detailed blog post about the process (idea, implementation, android & ios builds, release to Apple Store and Google Play)

**Web:** https://thirsty-joliot-e0fcfd.netlify.app/

**Android:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ionic.taps&pli=1

Apple Store release is coming real soon.

Plans for next versions:
- sounds (most of the logic is already implemented & sound assets are added)
- additional feedback based on scores

Additional Info:

This is just a (PoC) pet project. The code is not "clean" or in it's final form.
The background warp animation is done entirely with the Canvas API.
The rest of the transitions are done by CSS (and some with the Angular Animations library).
